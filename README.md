Briefly about the idea: 
EnergoServe is a digital-first platform that transforms the way people consume and manage energy. Instead of purchasing costly energy infrastructure like solar panels, batteries, or generators, users can subscribe to energy services on demand â€” paying only for what they use.
The platform simplifies access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy by offering personalized subscription plans for solar, storage, and backup power. It integrates IoT smart meters, AI-driven analytics, and transparent billing to give users real-time visibility into their energy usage, savings, and environmental impact.
EnergoServeâ€™s model removes technical barriers and upfront costs for customers while helping utilities and energy providers scale renewable adoption efficiently.
With this approach, energy becomes a seamless digital experience â€” as easy as streaming your favorite show or paying your phone bill â€” enabling a sustainable and resilient energy future.

EnerWise is a full-stack IoT-enabled platform powered by AI, cloud-native infrastructure, and real-time analytics â€” built for scalability, reliability, and transparency in delivering Energy-as-a-Service.

âš¡ Problem Statement â€” EnergoServe: Digital Energy-as-a-Service Platform
As the world transitions toward sustainable and decentralized energy systems, millions of households and small businesses continue to face three persistent challenges:
High upfront costs of renewable energy systems (like solar panels and batteries), making clean power adoption financially inaccessible.
Operational complexity in maintaining energy assets, understanding consumption data, and navigating grid or DISCOM regulations.
Lack of real-time visibility into energy usage, savings, and carbon impact â€” leading to inefficiency and distrust in service providers.
At the same time, the rise of IoT-enabled smart meters and digital payments creates an opportunity to redefine how energy is delivered and managed â€” not as a product, but as a subscription-based digital service.
The challenge is to build a scalable Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) digital platform that empowers consumers to subscribe, monitor, and manage clean energy services seamlessly â€” without owning infrastructure or dealing with technical or regulatory burdens.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
Simplify access to renewable energy through digital subscription models.
Enable real-time energy intelligence using IoT/smart meter data.
Ensure transparency and trust via automated billing, alerts, and AI-powered insights.
Support sustainability goals by tracking savings and carbon reduction.
Lay the foundation for grid integration, future DISCOM sync, and multi-service expansion.

ðŸ’¡ Vision
To make clean, reliable, and affordable energy accessible to everyone through a digital-first, AI-powered Energy-as-a-Service platform â€” transforming energy consumption into an intelligent, interactive, and sustainable experience.
